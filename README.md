# Arbitrary Artificial Neural Network

# TODO

1. Implement arbitrary hidden layers config (e.g. non-constant node count within hidden layers), utilizing `ndarray` crate

2. Add improved interface for inputting weights, given non-constant configuration this is extra important to be clear, but should maintain a matrix in the backend.
